"""Piglit integration for the now open sourced Khronos CTS tests being
developed at https://github.com/KhronosGroup/VK-GL-CTS

By default this will run GLES2, GLES3, GLES31, GLES32, and GLESEXT
test cases. Those desiring to run only a subset of them should
consider using the -t or -x options to include or exclude tests.

For example:
./piglit run khr_gles -c foo -t ES3- would run only ES3 tests (note
the dash to exclude ES31 tests)

This integration requires some configuration in piglit.conf, or the
use of environment variables.

In piglit.conf one should set the following:
[khr_gles]:bin -- Path to the glcts binary
[khr_gles]:extra_args -- any extra arguments to be passed to cts
(optional)

Alternatively (or in addition, since environment variables have
precedence), one could set:
PIGLIT_KHR_GLES_BIN -- environment equivalent of [khr_gles]:bin
PIGLIT_KHR_GLES_EXTRA_ARGS -- environment equivalent of
[khr_gles]:extra_args
