/* The GL 4.20 (Core Profile) spec says:
 *
 *     "2.11.7 Uniform Variables
 *
 *      ...
 *
 *      Uniform Blocks
 *
 *      ...
 *
 *      When a named uniform block is declared by multiple shaders in
 *      a program, it must be declared identically in each shader. The
 *      uniforms within the block must be declared with the same names
 *      and types, and in the same order. If a program contains
 *      multiple shaders with different declarations for the same
 *      named uniform block differs between shader, the program will
 *      fail to link."
 *
 * Although this restriction is not included in the
 * ARB_shading_language_420pack spec, it is reasonable to believe that
 * it applies to it too.
 *
 * Verify that a link error happens when using different binding
 * points for Uniform Blocks with the same name in different
 * compilation units.
