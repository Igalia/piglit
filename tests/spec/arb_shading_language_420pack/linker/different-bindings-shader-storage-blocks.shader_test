/* The GL 4.30 (Core Profile) spec says:
 *
 *     "7.8 Shader Buffer Variables and Shader Storage Blocks
 *
 *      ...
 *
 *      When a named shader storage block is declared by multiple
 *      shaders in a program, it must be declared identically in each
 *      shader. The buffer variables within the block must be declared
 *      with the same names, types, qualification, and declaration
 *      order. If a program contains multiple shaders with different
 *      declarations for the same named shader storage block, the
 *      program will fail to link."
 *
 * Although this restriction is not included in the
 * ARB_shading_language_420pack spec, it is reasonable to believe that
 * it applies to it too.
 *
 * Verify that a link error happens when using different binding
 * points for Shader Storage Blocks with the same name in different
 * compilation units.
