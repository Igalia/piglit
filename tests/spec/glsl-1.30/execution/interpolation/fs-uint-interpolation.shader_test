# Test that a vertex shader output that is declared as "flat uint" is
# properly received in the fragment shader.
#
# We do this by passing a value into both the vertex shader and the
# fragment shader as a uniform.  The vertex shader simply passes the
# uniform value along to the fragment shader as a flat varying.  The
# fragment shader compares the uniform to the flat varying it received
# from the vertex shader.
#
# To make sure that the GL implementation doesn't try to operate on
# "flat uint" values as though they were floats, this test includes
# bit patterns that would represent Inf or NaN as floats.
