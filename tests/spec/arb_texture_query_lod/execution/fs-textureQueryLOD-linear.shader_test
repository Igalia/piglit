# Create an 8x8 texture with four miplevels, colored red, green, blue, and
# white, respectively.  Draw the following:
#
#            .0        .5
#
# miplevel 3 +
#
# miplevel 2 +-+       +-+
#            +-+       +-+
#
# miplevel 1 +---+     +---+
#            |1.0|     |1.5|
#            +---+     +---+
#
#            +------+  +------+
# miplevel 0 | 0.0  |  | 0.5  |

# The ARB_texture_query_lod spec says:
#
#    "The x component of the result vector contains information on the mipmap
#     array(s) that would be accessed by a normal texture lookup using the
#     same coordinates. If a single level of detail would be accessed, the
#     level-of-detail number relative to the base level is returned."
#
# The results of texture() are compared with textureLod() as a sanity check,
# and then the x component of textureQueryLOD() is compared with what we
# calculated to be the LOD when doing linear filtering.
#
# Since this test uses no LOD-biasing, the base level is 0, and the
# ARB_texture_query_lod spec says:
#
#    "The computed level of detail lambda_prime (equation 3.19), relative to
#     the base level, is returned in the y component of the result vector."
#
# we also check that the y component returned by textureQueryLOD() is equal
# to the x component.

# Fractional LODs: linear filtering between miplevels
#
# Widths are calculated such that they correspond to fractional LODs. From the
# GL spec (section: Scale Factor and Level of Detail):
#
#	lambda_base(x, y) = log2(rho(x, y))
#
# where rho() is the scale factor. Since we're texturing squares, x == y and
# rho(x) is <width of base level> / x. Thus we can solve for x given lambda
# with
#	x = <width of base level> / (2^lambda)
