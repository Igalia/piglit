# Create an 8x8 texture with four miplevels, colored red, green, blue, and
# white, respectively.  Set TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER to NEAREST/LINEAR. Draw the
# following for each TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER:
#
#            NEAREST   LINEAR
#            +         +
#
#            +-+       +-+
#            +-+       +-+
#
#            +---+     +---+
#            |   |     |   |
#            +---+     +---+

#            +------+  +------+
#            |      |  |      |

#            +------+  +------+
#
# Instead of seeing differently colored squares as we would with a min-filter
# using mipmapping, we should see only red squares (textured from miplevel 0).
#
# The ARB_texture_query_lod spec says:
#
#    "The x component of the result vector contains information on the mipmap
#     array(s) that would be accessed by a normal texture lookup using the
#     same coordinates. If a single level of detail would be accessed, the
#     level-of-detail number relative to the base level is returned."
#
# and also gives pseudo-code:
#
#    "if (TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER is LINEAR or NEAREST) {
#       return 0.0;
#     }"
#
# So the x component of textureQueryLOD() must be zero.
#
# The ARB_texture_query_lod spec says:
#
#    "The computed level of detail lambda_prime (equation 3.19), relative to
#     the base level, is returned in the y component of the result vector."
#
# Since the base level is zero, the y component returned by textureQueryLOD()
# should be equal to what the miplevel would have been, had we used mipmapping.
