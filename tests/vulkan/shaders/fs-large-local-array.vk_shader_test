# Tests a large uint local array.
# Vulkan equivalent to tests/spec/glsl-1.30/execution/fs-large-local-array.shader_test
# And quoting from that test:
#
#    "Test correct handling of local-scope declared arrays large enough to
#     typically not fit into first level GPU memory such as its register file,
#     requiring storing/loading to some device-specific scratch space.
#
#     One hardware example is R600 where arrays larger than 124*vec4 cannot
#     fit into its GPR register file and has to be spilled to scratch memory.
#     As of 2017-03-06 this is the largest known register file of any GPU, so
#     the test uses that as a size to guarantee some form of spilling on any GPU."
