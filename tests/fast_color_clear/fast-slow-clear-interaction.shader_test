# Test the "fast clear" functionality of i965/gen7+ when two clears
# are done to the same buffer, but with drawing in between (so the
# second clear is not redundant).
#
# Fast clear functionality on i965/gen7+ operates by deferring the
# memory writes that would normally be done during a buffer clear so
# that they happen either during rendering or at the time buffer data
# is read (e.g. by glReadPixels).  If two fast clears appear in a row,
# the second clear can be elided.  But if other rendering (in this
# case a slow clear) occurrs between the two fast clears, the second
# fast clear is necessary, since some of the first fast clear's writes
# may already have been performed.
#
# In this test, we accomplish the slow clear by clearing to a color
# which is not supported by fast clear (0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
