"""Piglit integration for the now open sourced Khronos CTS tests being
developed at https://github.com/KhronosGroup/VK-GL-CTS

This will run GL45 test cases only.

This integration requires some configuration in piglit.conf, or the use of
environment variables.

In piglit.conf one should set the following:
[khr_gl45]:bin -- Path to the glcts binary
[khr_gl45]:extra_args -- any extra arguments to be passed to cts (optional)

Alternatively (or in addition, since environment variables have precedence),
one could set:
PIGLIT_KHR_GL_BIN -- environment equivalent of [khr_gl45]:bin
PIGLIT_KHR_GL_EXTRA_ARGS -- environment equivalent of [khr_gl45]:extra_args
