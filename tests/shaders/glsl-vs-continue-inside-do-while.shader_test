# From the GLSL 4.40 spec, section 6.4 (Jumps):
#
#     The continue jump is used only in loops. It skips the remainder
#     of the body of the inner most loop of which it is inside. For
#     while and do-while loops, this jump is to the next evaluation of
#     the loop condition-expression from which the loop continues as
#     previously defined.
#
# As of 1/31/2014 (commit db8b6fb), Mesa handles "continue" inside a
# do-while loop incorrectly; instead of jumping to the loop
# condition-expression, it jumps to the top of the loop.  This is
# particularly problematic because it can lead to infinite loops.
#
# This test verifies correct behaviour of "continue" inside do-while
# loops without risking an infinite loop.
