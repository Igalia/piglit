1. About
--------

Piglit is a collection of automated tests for OpenGL and OpenCL
implementations.

The goal of Piglit is to help improve the quality of open source
OpenGL and OpenCL drivers by providing developers with a simple means to
perform regression tests.

The original tests have been taken from
- Glean ( http://glean.sf.net/ ) and
- Mesa ( http://www.mesa3d.org/ )


2. Setup
--------

First of all, you need to make sure that the following are installed:

  - Python 2.7.x
  - Python Mako module
  - numpy (http://www.numpy.org)
  - cmake (http://www.cmake.org)
  - GL, glu and glut libraries and development packages (i.e. headers)
  - X11 libraries and development packages (i.e. headers)
  - waffle (http://www.waffle-gl.org)

Optionally, you can install the following:

  - nose. A python test framework, used for running the python framework
    test suite. (https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
  - lxml. An accelerated python xml library using libxml2 (http://lxml.de/)
  - simplejson. A fast C based implementation of the python json library.
    (https://simplejson.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)

Now configure the build system:

  $ ccmake .

This will start cmake's configuration tool, just follow the onscreen
instructions. The default settings should be fine, but I recommend you:
 - Press 'c' once (this will also check for dependencies) and then
 - Set "CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE" to "Debug"
Now you can press 'c' again and then 'g' to generate the build system.
Now build everything:

  $ make


2.1 Cross Compiling
-------------------

On Linux, if cross-compiling a 32-bit build on a 64-bit host, then you must
invoke cmake with option "-DCMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR=i386".


2.2 Ubuntu
----------

Install development packages.
  $ sudo apt-get install cmake g++ mesa-common-dev libgl1-mesa-dev python-numpy python-mako freeglut3-dev x11proto-gl-dev libxrender-dev

Install additional components for which Ubuntu packages do not yet exist:
  - waffle (http://www.waffle-gl.org)

Configure and build.
  $ cmake .
  $ make

Generate and exit.
  $ make


2.4 Cygwin

http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html

Install python mako.
  > c:\Python27\Scripts\pip.exe install mako

Open Visual Studio Command Prompt.
Start Menu->All Programs->Microsoft Visual Studio 2010->Visual Studio Tools->Visual Studio Command Prompt (2010)
CD to piglit directory.

Build from the Visual Studio Command Prompt.
  > nmake


3. How to run tests
-------------------

Make sure that everything is set up correctly:

  $ ./piglit-run.py tests/sanity.tests results/sanity.results

This will run some minimal tests.  If you built Piglit out-of-source, then the
environment variable PIGLIT_BUILD_DIR must be set:

  $ env PIGLIT_BUILD_DIR=/path/to/piglit/build/dir \
    ./piglit-run.py tests/sanity.tests results/sanity.results

Use

  $ ./piglit-run.py

To learn more about the command's syntax. Have a look into the tests/
directory to see what test profiles are available:

  $ ls tests/*.py

See also section 4.

To create some nice formatted test summaries, run

  $ ./piglit-summary-html.py summary/sanity results/sanity.results

Hint: You can combine multiple test results into a single summary.
      During development, you can use this to watch for regressions:

  $ ./piglit-summary-html.py summary/compare results/baseline.results results/current.results

      You can combine as many testruns as you want this way(in theory;
      the HTML layout becomes awkward when the number of testruns increases)

Have a look at the results with a browser:

  $ xdg-open summary/sanity/index.html

The summary shows the 'status' of a test:

 pass  This test has completed successfully.

 warn  The test completed successfully, but something unexpected happened.
       Look at the details for more information.

 fail  The test failed.

 skip  The test was skipped.

[Note: Once performance tests are implemented, 'fail' will mean that the test
       rendered incorrectly or didn't complete, while 'warn' will indicate a
       performance regression]
[Note: For performance tests, result and status will be different concepts.
       While status is always restricted to one of the four values above,
       the result can contain a performance number like frames per second]


4. Available test sets
----------------------

Test sets are specified as Python scripts in the tests directory.
The following test sets are currently available:

sanity.py
    This suite contains minimal sanity tests. These tests must
    pass, otherwise the other tests will not generate reliable results.

all.py
    This suite contains all OpenGL tests.

all_cl.py
    This suite contains all OpenCL tests.

quick.py
    Run all tests, but cut down significantly on their runtime
    (and thus on the number of problems they can find).
    In particular, this runs Glean with the --quick option, which
    reduces the number of visuals and state combinations tested.

radeon.py
r300.py
r500.py
    These test suites are adaptations of all.tests, with some tweaks
    to account for hardware limitations in Radeon chips.


5. How to write tests
---------------------

Every test is run as a separate process. This minimizes the impact that
severe bugs like memory corruption have on the testing process.

Therefore, tests can be implemented in an arbitrary standalone language.
I recommend C, C++ and Python, as these are the languages that are already
used in Piglit.

All new tests must be added to the all.py profile. The test profiles
are simply Python scripts. There are currently two supported test types:

 PlainExecTest
   This test starts a new process and watches the process output (stdout and
   stderr). Lines that start with "PIGLIT:" are collected and interpreted as
   a Python dictionary that contains test result details.

 GleanTest
   This is a test that is only used to integrate Glean tests

Additional test types (e.g. for automatic image comparison) would have to
be added to core.py.

Rules of thumb:
  Test process that exit with a nonzero returncode are considered to have
  failed.

  Output on stderr causes a warning.


6. Todo
-------

 Get automated tests into widespread use ;)

 Automate and integrate tests and demos from Mesa
   Add code that automatically tests whether the test has rendered correctly

 Performance regression tests
   Ideally, this should be done by summarizing / comparing a history of
   test results
   Note that while some small artificial micro-benchmark could be added to
   Piglit, the Phoronix test suite is probably a better place for
   realistic performance testing.
