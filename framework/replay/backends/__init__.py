"""Provides a module like interface for dump backends.

This package provides an abstract interface for working with dump backends,
which implement various functions as provided in the Registry class, and then
provide a Registry instance as REGISTRY, which maps individual objects to
objects that piglit expects to use. This module then provides a thin
abstraction layer so that piglit is never aware of what backend it's using, it
just asks for an object and receives one.

Most consumers will want to import framework.replay.backends and work directly
with the helper functions here. For some more detailed uses (test cases
especially) the modules themselves may be used.

When this module is loaded it will search through framework/replay/backends for
python modules (those ending in .py), and attempt to import them. Then it will
look for an attribute REGISTRY in those modules, and if it as a
framework.replay.register.Registry instance, it will add the name of that
module (sans .py) as a key, and the instance as a value to the DUMPBACKENDS
dictionary. Each of the helper functions in this module uses that dictionary to
find the function that a user actually wants.
