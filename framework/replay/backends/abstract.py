    """ Base class for dump backends

    This class provides an basic ancestor for classes implementing dump
    backends, providing a light public API. The goal of this API is to be "just
    enough", not a generic writing solution. To that end it provides the
    method, 'dump'. This method is designed to be just enough to write a
    backend without needing format specific options.

        This method takes keyword arguments that define options for the
        backends. Options should be prefixed to identify which backends they
        apply to. For example, an apitrace specific value should be passed as
        apitrace_*, while a file gfxrecon value should be passed as gfxrecon_*)
