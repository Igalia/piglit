    This writes out to piglit's native json backend. This class uses the python
    json module or the simplejson.

    This class is atomic, writes either completely fail or completely succeed.
    To achieve this it writes individual files for each test and for the
    metadata, and composes them at the end into a single file and removes the
    intermediate files. When it tries to compose these files if it cannot read
    a file it just ignores it, making the result atomic.
